> **NOTE:** This post represents an updated version of the prior one 
>["Process Mass-Media relations for Language Models with AREkit"](https://nicolay-r.github.io/blog/articles/2022-05/process-mass-media-relations-with-arekit)
; in the prior one we describe sampling process from scratch and under older API version *AREkit-0.22.0*.

In this post we consider that the prior AREkit tutorials tutorials were passed:
1. [Binding a custom annotated collection for Relation Extraction](https://nicolay-r.github.io/blog/articles/2022-08/arekit-collection-bind)
2. [Compose your text-processing pipeline!
](https://nicolay-r.github.io/blog/articles/2022-08/arekit-text-parsing-pipeline)
3. [Craft your text-opinion annotation pipeline!](https://nicolay-r.github.io/blog/articles/2022-08/arekit-text-opinion-annotation-pipeline)
4. [Data Folding Setup](https://nicolay-r.github.io/blog/articles/2022-09/arekit-sampling)

## Text Opinion Samplers

1. For conventional neural networks, i.e. **Convolutional NN's**, **Recurrent NN's**.


2. For BERT model.
