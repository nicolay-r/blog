The recent LLM capabilities of understanding text relations are insane 🔥 
Especially when it is well and nicely visualized!

I've tried to checkout how ChatGPT-3.5 is aligned with the manually annotated data, and that is what makes me think different about prompts!

This Wednesday, will be delighted to share the results of the largest known collection of annotated news 📰 in Russian with more than 40 relation types: NEREL 
([https://aclanthology.org/2021.ranlp-1.100/](https://aclanthology.org/2021.ranlp-1.100/))
