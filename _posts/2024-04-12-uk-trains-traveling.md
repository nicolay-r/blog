> Unexpected traveling plan: 1-2 Initial Route âš«, but I took 3-4 ðŸ”´

**Manchester Picadilly station** represents one of the larges hub that connects South-West UK county. Once you calling [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester), no matter coach or train, you instantly becoming aware of it. 
I used to callig that place for a long time, and it used to be journeys from far away: Newcastle, and so far London (Euston train station) in this list. 
Hoever, there is a known psychological effect that finds manipulative applications in certain industries and involves repretitive series of actions with the same outcome.  
Something you're doing quite often through the same path makes you a biased person to the certain extent in the particular domain area. 
This is what happened and you may find yourself the same way...

I remember one been traveling back with no delays and rush. 
The autopilot mode on traveling, accompanied with the relaed app assistances is what basically relaxes you.
Sometemies you may find it too suspicious and end up being confused by thinking too much or by raising a wise questions.
The one that came up to me so far, on my two-leg trip from Bolton (Manchester suburban train) to London (Euston train station).
And the question was as follows:

> *How the hell the app notifies me to take a train that goes absolutely different direction?!*

I was too lucky to end up into this right at the arrival time of expected train. 
Being confused I asked staff on how to call I should call Manchester with this train. 
That's exacly how my journey of this post begins, accompanied by the following response:

> *Well, to call that place you have to change the platform an take the next train.*

Believing in confidence of the professionals helps you to cope. So I did.
Only and after a while I realise when the bias works against me: the station is intented to be called was different... 
Different city, which was [Blackburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn)

That opens the story of how I missed the train but just not entering in it.
Accepting my failure, It was decided to came to the same officer for the related recommendations on picking another traveling route.
As it usually happens in the UK, the officer treat the overall action happened with her assistance as a problem that bothrers her too.
She was intended to help me and later on suggester another route: call [Preston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston,_Lancashire) and travel from there to London.

So I did:

> Preston train station

The good aspect is that traveling was free of charge for me ðŸ¥³
But then you may wonder: how you can get to the South (London) with the train that has prescribed seats in tickets?
Well, in the UK they have so-called reserved train coaches. They may refer to it as "Universal" and therefore several trains may have "U' coaches as the one below:

> I took this "U" coach of the train, where anyone is free to take a sit wheereever they wish!
