**Sentiment attitude extraction** [[6]](#references) -- is a sentiment analysis subtask, in which attitude corresponds 
to the text position conveyed by Subject towards other Object mentioned in text such as: 
entities, events, etc. 

In this post we focused on the sentiment relation extraction between **mentioned named entities** in text, based on
**sampled contexts** of Mass-Media news written in Russian.
In terms of sentiments, we focused on two-scale sentiment analysis problem and consider: *positive* and *negative* attitudes.
Samples were generated by 
[AREkit](https://github.com/nicolay-r/AREkit)
and then utilized for [BERT classification model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) training
by means of [DeepPavlov](https://deeppavlov.ai/) framework.

For a greater details related to samples preparation details, 
please follow the related post 
[Process Mass-Media relations for Language Models with AREkit](https://nicolay-r.github.io/blog/articles/2022-05/process-mass-media-relations-with-arekit).

In this article we focusing on already prepared contexts from [RuSentRel](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentRel) collection.

Figure below illustrates an example of **sampled contexts** of Mass-Media texts written in Russian, utilized for finetuning.
Structurally, sampled contexts are stored in form of CSV file, in which every row represents a **context** from a document. 
Context -- is a sentence part with mentioned **subject-object pair** in it, where `#S` and `#O` corresponds to subject and object respectively.
Each context may have a `label` which could be one of the following: *positive* (1), *negative* (2), or *neutral* (0).
Neutral class has been artificially invented in order to illustrate the absence of sentiment connection between 
subject-object pair.

Every context representation is designed for BERT model [input format](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) and describes a couple input parts: `text_a` and `text_b`.
We utilize `text_b` as a [prompt](https://github.com/nicolay-r/awesome-sentiment-attitude-extraction#prompts-and-knowledge-examination)
that allows emphasize the presence of subject-object pair in context. 
In this example we focused on a predefined prompt, dubbed as `nli-m` [[7]](#references).

As subject and object values, all the mentioned named entities are considered to display hidden and denoted as `#e`.
All the entity-related information were demarcated into other CSV columns (see `entities` group of columns in figure below).

Let's get started with the required **data preparation** stage, which includes:
* input data preparation (RuSentRel collection processing)
* BERT pretrained model state

As for text samples, we consider the contents of [RuSentRel](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentRel) collection which represents 
analytical articles from `insomi.ru` portal, written in Russian.

As for the BERT initial state, we consider `BERT-base-mult` (multilingual, `base`-sized model) which 
has been finetuned with texts and news titles from [RuAttitudes-2.0-Large](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuAttitudes) collection.
The latter represents a distant-supervision approach ([knowledge-based](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentiFrames), see paper [[5]](#references)) 
towards mass-media collection of news. 
RuAttitudes includes `~135K` news with annotated attitudes between mentioned named entities.
For a greater details please proceed with the related [[3]](#references).

The first step is to download the [RuSentRel](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentRel) prepared samples for BERT model training.
* [[download RuSentRel samples]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iltg28qth6qjuhv/sample-train-0.tsv.gz?dl=1)

Next setup BERT-pretrained state.
This is a `SentRuBERT` [[4]](#references) model finetuned with the [RuAttitudes-2.0-Large](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuAttitudes) collection.
* [[download BERT finetuned model state]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g73osmwyrqtr2at/ra-20-srubert-large-neut-nli-pretrained-3l-finetuned.tar.gz?dl=1)

The input data represents and archive of the CSV formatter list of input contexts:
```python
# Declaring input-related parameters.
input_data = "sample-train-0.tsv.gz"
```

The initial step model is to provide references onto files of the BERT state:

```python
# Declaring BERT state related parameters. 
model_dir = "./ra-20-srubert-large-neut-nli-pretrained-3l"
bert_config_file = join(model_dir, "bert_config.json")
bert_ckpt_file = join(model_dir, "model.ckpt-30238")
vocab_file = join(model_dir, "vocab.txt")
do_lowercase = True

# Training parameters.
epochs_count = 4
batch_size = 2 
```

In order to perform samples classification, we adopt BERT classifier (`bert_classifier`) from [DeepPavlov (0.11.0)](https://deeppavlov.ai/) library.

According to the personal experience, **It is was important** to mention here a load path parameter: `load_path=model_checkpoint_path`.
Since only the latter allows to perform a complete model loading, including the classification layer ontop of the BERT backbone.

```python
# Model classifier.
model = bert_classifier.BertClassifierModel(
    bert_config_file=bert_config_file,
    load_path=bert_ckpt_file, # IMPORTANT: intialize classification layer!
    keep_prob=0.1,
    n_classes=3,
    save_path="out",
    learning_rate=2e-5)

# Setup processor.
bert_proc = BertPreprocessor(vocab_file=vocab_file, 
                             do_lower_case=do_lowercase, 
                             max_seq_length=128)
```

[AREkit](https://github.com/nicolay-r/AREkit/tree/0.22.0-rc) provides a `BaseRowsStorage` with API for samples iteration, implemented over `pandas` library.

The most **important notion here** was to perform shuffled data iteration. 
Most contexts are 0-labeled, it results in conspiracy during model training.
Among all the parameters, we keep `text_a`, `text_b` and `label`:

```python
def iter_batches(s, batch_size):
    assert(isinstance(s, BaseRowsStorage))

    data = {"text_a": [], "text_b": [], "label": []}

    # NOTE: it is important to iter shuffled data!
    for row_ind, row in s.iter_shuffled():      # IMPORTANT: shuffle data!
        data["text_a"].append(row['text_a'])
        data["text_b"].append(row['text_b'])
        data["label"].append(row['label'])

    for i in range(0, len(data["text_a"]), batch_size):

        texts_a = data["text_a"][i:i + batch_size]
        texts_b = data["text_b"][i:i + batch_size]
        labels = data["label"][i:i + batch_size]

        batch_features = bert_proc(texts_a=texts_a, texts_b=texts_b)

        yield batch_features, labels
```

We track the BERT sentiment classification model finetuning as follows:

```python
samples = BaseRowsStorage.from_tsv(input_data)
for e in range(epochs_count):

    it = iter_batches(samples, batch_size)
    batches = len(samples.DataFrame) / batch_size

    total_loss = 0
    pbar = tqdm(it, total=batches, desc="Epoch: {}".format(e), unit='batches')
    for batch_index, payload in enumerate(pbar):
        features, y = payload
        d = model.train_on_batch(features=features, y=y)
        total_loss += d["loss"]
        pbar.set_postfix({
            "avg-loss": total_loss/(batch_index+1)
        })
```

At last we keep the result model state as follows:
```pytnon
model.save()
```

### BERT Finetuned state Analysis

Let's take a look on how it affects on the result for the following sample:

*ведя такую игру, `#s` окончательно лишилась доверия `#о` и стран `#e`. [SEP] `#s` к `#o` в контексте: << `#s` окончательно лишилась доверия `#o` >> [SEP]*

> NOTE: we adopt entity masking and therefore replace entities with `#e`, object with `#o` and subject with `#s`.
> Being trained, the result model is independent from the statistics between mentioned named entities.

In order to analyse attention weights we adopt approach [[1]](#references).
Considering a `HEAD#2` of the BERT transformer for layers (from left to right): `2`, `4`, `8`, `11`.
In addition, you may also checkout for a greater details the following paper [[2]](#references).

For the **pretrained state**:

![alt text]({{site.url}}/img/example_bert_2-4-8-11-head2-m2-pretrained.png)

1. The contents of the [RuAttitudes-2.0-Large](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuAttitudes) collection 
 yields of a large amount of news titles with annotated subject-object pairs and
 mentioned frames in between them: `окончательно`, `лишилась`, `доверия`;
2. Smoothed attention distribution onto the top layers (11) is a specifics of the `SentRuBERT` [[4]](#references) training organization.

After `4` epochs of the **finetuned** state:

![alt text]({{site.url}}/img/example_bert_2-4-8-11-head2-m2-finetuned.png)

1. It is possible to investigate the greater attention onto `#0` and `#S` objects in sample
 (on top layers)
2. Attention become greater for frames of the 
[RuSentiFrames](https://github.com/nicolay-r/RuSentiFrames): `окончательно`, `лишилась`, `доверия`; 
the latter utlized in RuAttitudes collection development as a knowledge-base.

In the next post we cover the pre-trained model application for unlabeled Mass-Media texts 
using BRAT toolset as a front-end.

The latter finetuned model become a source of the following [DEMO](https://github.com/nicolay-r/ARElight/#docker-verion-quick).

### Summary
The most important aspects deal with once experiment with BERT 
application for sentiment classification task were as follows:
1. Consider the classification layer hidden state loading as well 
(`load_path=model_checkpoint_path` for DeepPavlov library)
2. Guarantee shuffled and class-balanced input data.
