Sampling of the contexts with mentioned sentiment relations in it has become even simple to use rather it was before! 

So far we work hard on the following features that make the application of this process as well as the application of the obtained results even more handy.
Here is the upcoming [features and changes](https://github.com/nicolay-r/arekit-ss/issues/53) in `AREkit-ss` 0.24.0:

✔️: Support of the `sqlite3` for storing the results

✔️: Refactored backend of the translator, enhanced translation with masked spans in texts

✔️: [**Dynamic import**](https://github.com/nicolay-r/arekit-ss/issues/62) and sources registration, which is basically means errors in one source won't affect the overall behavior of the application.

✔️: Support for the following collections: [NEREL](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/4/btad161/7099619) and [BioNEREL](https://aclanthology.org/2021.ranlp-1.100/)

✔️: Other bug fixes aimed on better adaption of the result texts for LLM, optional entities masking flexibilities
